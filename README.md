# Comparison to similar games (like Pokémon GO)
**«TON Quest» has several key advantages over Pokémon GO, making it unique and potentially more attractive to certain audiences:**

**Blockchain and NFT Integration**
1. True Ownership: Unlike Pokémon GO, where items and Pokémon are owned only within the game, «TON Quest» uses blockchain to create NFTs 
(non-fungible tokens). This allows players to truly own their virtual objects, trade them, or use them in other blockchain-based projects.
1. Monetization: Players can earn real money by selling rare NFTs to other
users, providing an additional incentive to participate in the game.

**User-Created Quests**
1. User-Generated Content: «TON Quest» allows players to create their own quests and hide treasures, adding a creative and social activity element. It also creates potential income sources for players, as their quests can be monetized.
1. Social Interaction: The ability to create and share quests enhances engagement and fosters community development around the game.

**Real and Virtual Rewards**
1. Mixing Real and Virtual Prizes: In «TON Quest» players can find not only virtual objects but also real rewards such as discounts, coupons, or physical items, increasing the value and motivation to participate.
1. Partnership Programs: The ability to integrate with real brands and companies to provide physical prizes can attract a broader audience.

**TON-Based Economy**
1. Decentralized Economy: Using TON as a platform allows the creation of a decentralized and sustainable in-game economy, where players can earn tokens by participating in quests, creating content, and trading. These tokens can be used within the game or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money.
1. No Middlemen: Transactions between players are direct, thanks to smart
contracts on the blockchain, eliminating intermediaries and reducing fees.

**Transparency and Security**
1. Transparent Transactions: All transactions and operations related to NFTs and in-game assets are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and security.
1. Fraud Protection: The use of smart contracts and blockchain reduces the
risk of fraud and cheating, providing fair and safe conditions for all participants.

**Innovative Gameplay**
1. AR Engagement: While Pokémon GO uses AR to interact with Pokémon, «TON Quest» can offer a deeper level of integration with the environment and diverse AR scenarios related to treasure hunting and discovery.
1. Flexible Quests: With user-generated content and diverse tasks, the game
can offer a wider range of quests, from simple scavenger hunts to complex multiplayer scenarios.

# Conclusion
**The advantages of «TON Quest» make it more attractive to users interested in cryptocurrencies, true digital ownership, and social interactions. These features provide a deeper immersion and engagement than traditional augmented reality games like Pokémon GO.**
